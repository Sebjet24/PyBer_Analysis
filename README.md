# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the analysis:

V. Isualize has assigned me and Omar a new mission. We'll generate a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using my Python abilities and understanding of Pandas. Then, with the help of Pandas and Matplotlib, we'll make a multi-line graph that displays the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we'll provide a written report summarizing how the data differs by city type and how PyBer decision-makers may exploit those distinctions. 

## Results:

- The number of drivers, rides, and total fares are lowest in rural areas.
- The number of drivers, rides, and total fares are highest in urban areas.
- Suburban cities are in the middle having the 2nd most drivers, rides and total fares.
- Despite the fact that rural cities have the fewest drivers, trips, and fares, they have the highest average fare per ride and fare per driver.
- Despite having the most drivers, trips, and fares, urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and fare per driver.

## Summary

### 3 Recommendations:

From our data we are able to tell what kind of fares will be commanded based on what city type the passenger is catching a ride in. Here are three business suggestions to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:

 - Assign different city categories to your drivers based on the sorts of places they regularly operate in.
 - In urban cities, charge more per mile because excursions are likely to be shorter and drivers do not make as much each trip.
 - Calculate modest charge increases or decreases based on the number of riders in the city at the moment.
